# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College.

Project Proposal - Kian Raissian and Ilya Besancon
02/23/17
What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?
Our main idea is to create a game that is similar to snake. We want to explore different forms of user input, anything past using arrow keys for motion. Our MVP is to make the regular snake game without having it change length. Our stretch goals are: growing snake from eating blocks, different color blocks that change the color of the snake, and high scores from how many blocks it eats.
What are your learning goals for this project (for each member)?
-Better understand objects and classes
-Have an end product that we enjoy
-Push ourselves to be more creative and better coders through making this project
What libraries are you planning to use? (if you donâ€™t know enough yet, please outline how you will decide this question during the beginning phase of the project).
We are going to primarily use pygame for this project.
What do you plan to accomplish by the mid-project check-in? (See below for some generic goals; edit to suit your particular project)
We want to have a basic but running version of the game snake by the mid-project check-in.
What do you view as the biggest risks to you being successful on this project?
Current lack of comfort in understanding classes and objects.
